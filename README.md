# graph-viz

A graph visualizer for visualizing graphs because you don't want to deal with
auto-generating non-sense and instead want to use a physics engine to spread
the nodes out for you.

Draws with p5.js and physics with Matter.js.

# Running

For development, we simply recommend being in the root directory for this
repository and simply using Python's `http.server` to serve the files for you.

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

You can then go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) and see it
for yourself.
